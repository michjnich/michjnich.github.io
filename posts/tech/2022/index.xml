Not a very controversial statement that, as most web projects probably need to send the occasional email.
To make testing during the dev phase easy, I&amp;rsquo;ve configured the project to use the django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend backend, which just writes an email to a file in a directory you specify. This means I can just open up the file, read and visually verify the email, and click on any links (eg.</description></item><item><title>Colourblind settings for Git</title><link>https://michjnich.github.io/posts/tech/2022/2022_09_21_colourblind_settings_for_git/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 15:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://michjnich.github.io/posts/tech/2022/2022_09_21_colourblind_settings_for_git/</guid><description>Like around 12% of people on the planet, I am colour-blind. Mine isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad compared to others, and is the common red/green kind (protanopia).
I still like to use colours in my terminals though, as I find the various highlights useful, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share the colours I have set up for git to make life easy for me.
Just copy/paste the following into your ~/.gitconfig file, and of course if any of these colours don&amp;rsquo;t work for you, just change them to something that does (mostly what I&amp;rsquo;ve done is get rid of the dark reds and blues, which are very hard for me to see on a blackish terminal background.</description></item><item><title>Debugging Django in a Docker container</title><link>https://michjnich.github.io/posts/tech/2022/2022_09_17_debug_django_in_docker/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2022 09:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://michjnich.github.io/posts/tech/2022/2022_09_17_debug_django_in_docker/</guid><description>Have you ever tried hunting for a bug in a Django app that&amp;rsquo;s running in a Docker container? It&amp;rsquo;s not always a trivial process and can have you dotting print statements all over the place because you can&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to use breakpoints properly inside the Docker container.
Well, fortunately there is a solution to this. 2 solutions even.
Solution 1: Configure VS Code to debug a dockerised app Step 1 - Configure VS Code VS Code has built in debugging support for a variety of languages.</description></item><item><title>Power-up your DuckDuckGo searches with !bangs</title><link>https://michjnich.github.io/posts/tech/2022/2022_04_06_duckduckgo_bangs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 15:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://michjnich.github.io/posts/tech/2022/2022_04_06_duckduckgo_bangs/</guid><description>DuckDuckGo continues to gain ground over Google for searches, not least because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t track you. But is it as efficient as Google, and how can you get more out of it? Here are 5 simple tips:
Make use of !bangs DuckDuckGo has had bangs for years, though I only discovered them recently. Put simply, a bang allows you to perform a search directly on another site, from the DuckDuckGo site.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to v2 of michjnich.com</title><link>https://michjnich.github.io/posts/tech/2022/2022_04_03_welcome_to_v2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 20:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://michjnich.github.io/posts/tech/2022/2022_04_03_welcome_to_v2/</guid><description>Welcome &amp;hellip; &amp;hellip; to v2 of my personal site.
Version 1 was created using mkdocs and deployed on GitHub pages. Mkdocs is extremely simple to use and a powerful tool, but perhaps not ideal for a more &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; looking site.
