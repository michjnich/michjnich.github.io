Version 1 was created using mkdocs and deployed on GitHub pages. Mkdocs is extremely simple to use and a powerful tool, but perhaps not ideal for a more &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; looking site. While I could have run a blog using mkdocs, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely practical, and it was for that reason I then set up a seperate tech blog site.

Are you working at a company that has a legacy monolith that you&amp;rsquo;d like to get rid of?
Are you sure?
Maybe you think you should migrate it to a microservice-based architecture? After all, that&amp;rsquo;s what all the cool kids are using these days, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?
