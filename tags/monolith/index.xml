Are you working at a company that has a legacy monolith that you&amp;rsquo;d like to get rid of?
Are you sure?
Maybe you think you should migrate it to a microservice-based architecture? After all, that&amp;rsquo;s what all the cool kids are using these days, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?
Before you do that, just stop and think a moment about what it is you actually need, and what problems you are trying to solve by considering what I presume would be a fairly major transformation project.</description></item></channel></rss>
